# How to Use Flyff Awakening Bots to Enhance Your Items
 
Flyff is a popular MMORPG game that allows players to customize their equipment with various stats and effects. One of the ways to do this is by using awakening scrolls, which can randomly add or change an attribute on an item. However, awakening scrolls are expensive and rare, and the process of awakening can be tedious and time-consuming. That's why some players use flyff awakening bots to automate the task and get the best possible awakes for their items.

A flyff awakening bot is a software that simulates mouse clicks and keyboard inputs to perform the awakening process for you. It can read the text of the awake on the item and compare it with your desired criteria. If the awake does not meet your expectations, it will use another scroll and try again until it does or runs out of scrolls. Some bots can also support multiple servers, custom awakes, mixed awakes, and other advanced features.
 
There are many flyff awakening bots available online, but not all of them are safe or reliable. Some may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. Some may also be detected by the game's anti-cheat system and result in a ban or suspension of your account. Therefore, you should always be careful when downloading and using flyff awakening bots.
 
One of the most trusted and popular flyff awakening bots is AiWake-Lite by netHoxInc and Aiden. It is designed for the private server Insanity Flyff, but it can also work on other servers with some configuration.
